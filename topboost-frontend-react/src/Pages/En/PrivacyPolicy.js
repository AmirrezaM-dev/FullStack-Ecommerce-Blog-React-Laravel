					<p>
						If you want to know what personal data we have about
						you, you can ask us for details of that personal data
						and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is
						held). This is known as a “subject access request”.
					</p>
					<p>
						All subject access requests should be made in writing
						and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part
						15. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject
						Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do
						not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to
						tell us everything we need to know to respond to your
						request as quickly as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is not normally any charge for a subject access
						request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or
						excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive
						requests) a fee may be charged to cover our
						administrative costs in responding.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will respond to your subject access request within 21
						days and, in any case, not more than one month of
						receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete
						response, including a copy of your personal data within
						that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your
						request is more complex, more time may be required up to
						a maximum of three months from the date we receive your
						request. You will be kept fully informed of our
						progress.
